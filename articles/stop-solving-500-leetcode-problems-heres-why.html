## 🔧 The System
Last week, I had a conversation with a senior technical person from one of India's top MNCs. What he told me stopped me mid-sentence.

"We've stopped looking for people who can write code. We need people who can read code, analyze it, and come up with creative ideas on AI platforms."

Let that sink in.

Most students I meet are doing what they've been told works - solve 200 to 500 LeetCode problems, memorize syntax, practice writing code faster. They believe that the student who writes the most code wins.

Here's what I see from my desk: that era is ending.

What companies actually care about now is this - if two students solve the same problem, and one writes it in 5 lines and the other in 20, companies don't care who wrote more. They care about which solution executes faster, uses less memory, and scales better. Every millisecond matters in a real-time production environment.

The shift is subtle but real. The interview rounds still look the same on paper - technical round, then HR round. But inside those rounds, the approach has completely changed. Companies are no longer asking students to sit down and write code on a whiteboard. Instead, they're having conversations. They want to hear you explain your thinking. They want you to argue why one algorithm is better than another for a specific scenario.

Some companies have already started running creativity-focused assessment rounds instead of traditional coding tests. It hasn't become the standard everywhere yet - but from what I'm seeing, within a year or two, most companies will follow.

Students who are still preparing the old way will walk into interviews and realize the game has changed.

## 💡 The Insider Truth
Here's something most students don't know: companies are now asking candidates how they use AI in their own learning.

Not "can you use ChatGPT to write code." That's not what they mean. They want to know - are you the kind of person who uses AI to challenge your own thinking? Can you paste your solution into an AI tool and ask it "why is this approach better than the alternative?" Can you argue back when the 
AI suggests a different algorithm?

Companies don't want you to hide the fact that you use AI. They want to see that you're smart enough to use it as a thinking partner - and confident enough to push back on it when you disagree.
The students who will get placed in the next 2–3 years aren't the ones who solved the most problems. They're the ones who can think about problems in a way that AI alone cannot.

## ✅ Your One Move This Week
Your resume is your first identity. Before any company meets you, that one page speaks for you.
This week, open your resume and do this: remove every vague line. No "familiar with various technologies." No "good communication skills." Instead, list the specific skills you've actually worked on - the tools, frameworks, and technologies you've used in projects. Keep each point crisp and clear. One line, one skill, one proof.

If a recruiter can't understand what you bring in 10 seconds of scanning, your resume isn't ready.
